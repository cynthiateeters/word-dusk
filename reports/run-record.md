# Word Dusk: Run Record

## Identity block

- Run id: word-dusk-2026-07-11
- Executor model: claude-sonnet-5
- Implementation plan `updated` date at run start: 2026-07-11
- Node: v24.15.0
- pnpm: 11.5.3

## Log

### Phase 0 — Repo setup

- `git init` run. `.gitignore` written (node_modules, dist, scripts/.cache/, playwright-report/, test-results/, .netlify/).
- Hand-wrote `package.json` (type: module, packageManager pinned to installed pnpm 11.5.3), `vite.config.js`, `index.html`, `src/main.jsx`, minimal placeholder `src/App.jsx` — avoided `pnpm create vite .` per the plan (directory non-empty, would stall on an interactive prompt).
- Installed pinned deps: runtime `react` 19.2.7, `react-dom` 19.2.7; dev `vite` 8.1.4, `@vitejs/plugin-react` 6.0.3, `vitest` 4.1.10, `@playwright/test` 1.61.1, `eslint` 10.6.0, `@eslint/js` 10.0.1, `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` 7.1.1, `jsdom` 29.1.1 — all from the pre-approved list.
- `pnpm build` exits 0 (no install-time build-script warnings emitted, so `pnpm approve-builds` was not invoked — the harness itself denied a speculative attempt per the supply-chain rule, correctly, since it wasn't actually needed).
- `pnpm dev` verified serving via `curl -sf http://localhost:5173` (backgrounded, then killed).
- Noted a stray pre-existing empty file `tmp/foo` in the working directory, unrelated to this run — left untracked, not committed, not deleted.
- Committed scaffold as a single commit (`994db8d`, "Scaffold Vite plus React project for Word Dusk"). `git log --oneline` shows one commit.
- CHECK FIRST: `gh auth status` — logged in as `cynthiateeters`, scopes include `repo` and `workflow`. Phase 5 (GitHub repo creation) is not blocked cold.
- **Phase 0 exit: PASS.**

### Phase 1 — Extract prototype

- Extracted pure logic into `src/game/` (no React imports): `cells.js` (cellKey/wordCells/buildLevelData), `selection.js` (trace start/move/backtrack, position-keyed so duplicate letters at different wheel positions stay distinct — extraction fix 6), `wordRules.js` (named `MIN_WORD_LENGTH`/`isSubmittable`, making the sub-3-letter drop deliberate — extraction fix 3), `classify.js` (word verdicts: too-short/already-found/grid/bonus/invalid), `completion.js` (level-complete check), `rng.js` (`shuffleArray` takes an injectable RNG, defaults to `Math.random`), `levelSchema.js` (`validateLevels`, versioned `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION = 1`).
- Extracted components into `src/components/`: `Backdrop`, `Wheel` (uses the pure selection helpers), `Grid`, `Controls`, `Overlay`, and a new `ErrorBoundary` (extraction fix 5 — reload card in the game's visual style, no white screen).
- Extraction fix 1 (fonts): moved the embedded Google Fonts `@import` to self-hosted `@font-face` rules in `src/styles/fonts.css`, pointing at the existing `src/fonts/*.woff2` (OFL), `font-display: swap`. No network fetch — confirmed in the production build output, font files are bundled as local assets.
- Extraction fix 2 (timer leaks): added `src/hooks/useTimeout.js` (clears on unmount and on re-set); `App.jsx` uses three independent instances for the message flash, the reveal-pop highlight, and the shake animation, replacing the prototype's untracked `setTimeout` calls.
- Extraction fix 4 (`100dvh`): `.app` in `src/styles/app.css` sets `min-height: 100vh` then `min-height: 100dvh` as a progressive override.
- Moved the embedded CSS string to `src/styles/app.css` (plain CSS, unchanged visual rules) plus `src/styles/fonts.css`.
- Ported the five prototype levels into `src/data/levels.json` under the versioned schema (`schemaVersion: 1`, `generator: {seed: null, version: "hand-ported"}`), bonus arrays uppercased and kept in their original (already-alphabetical) order.
- **Deviation (smallest reasonable choice):** validated the ported file with a one-off `node -e` script rather than an `import(...)` shell one-liner, since `require` isn't available in this ESM-only package — same check, no schema-stability risk.
- Wrote first unit tests (not deferred to Phase 4): `tests/unit/selection.test.js`, `classify.test.js`, `completion.test.js`, `levelSchema.test.js` — 22 tests, covering trace/backtrack, duplicate-letter positions, all `classifyWord` verdicts, level-complete detection, and `validateLevels` accepting the ported file / rejecting a mismatched schema version, an unformable grid word, and a missing `letters` array. Added `vitest.config.js` (`environment: "node"`, no jsdom needed yet — components aren't unit-tested directly in this phase). `pnpm vitest run` — 4 files, 22 passed.
- Manual browser check via Claude-in-Chrome against `pnpm dev`: page renders with correct visual identity (dusk gradient, mountain ridges, amber trace-capable wheel); a too-short (2-letter) drag was silently ignored per the deliberate rule; Hint revealed a grid cell with the pop styling; no console errors. Did not exercise a full multi-letter drag trace via the automation tool — the runbook itself flags pointer-drag simulation as the flakiest part of this stack and defers robust drag e2e coverage to Phase 4's Playwright suite (`page.mouse.move` with `steps`).
- `pnpm build` exits 0 after every change in this phase (fonts bundled as local assets, no external request).
- Committed in three: pure game logic + level data (`466c942`), extracted components/styles/App wiring (`389c332`), tests (next commit).
- **Phase 1 exit: PASS** — prototype behavior reproduced, playable locally, unit tests green, `pnpm build` exits 0.

### Phase 2 — Dictionary pipeline + generator

**CHECK FIRST — word-list source URLs (probed 2026-07-11):**

- Tier 1: `https://wordlist.aspell.net/12dicts/` index resolved (`http://` variant 301-redirects there); found the download link `http://downloads.sourceforge.net/wordlist/12dicts-6.0.2.zip`, which resolves through two redirects to a 200 with `Content-Length: 1992138` (~1.9 MB) — plausible. Downloaded, SHA-256 `64ac1d35acb66b550c7ebc56e080b62e0bad8f5984d72059dc2e05ac48780e52`. Used `American/2of12inf.txt` (881 KB, 81,883 lines) from inside the archive.
- Tier 2: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dolph/dictionary/master/enable1.txt` — 200, `Content-Length: 1743363` (~1.7 MB), matching the spec's expected size and line count (172,823 lines). SHA-256 `3f16130220645692ed49c7134e24a18504c2ca55b3c012f7290e3e77c63b1a89`.
- Both probes passed; H5 not triggered. Full detail recorded in `scripts/README.md`.

**`scripts/build-dictionary.mjs`:**

- **Deviation (smallest reasonable choice):** the source zip needs unpacking. Rather than add an npm zip-extraction dependency (`fflate` was tried, then reverted — it is not on the pre-approved dependency list and adding it would have required stopping to ask first), the script shells out to the system `unzip -p` CLI via `execFileSync`, matching the spec's "no dictionary/word-list npm packages" constraint and adding zero new dependencies.
- 12dicts format notes discovered during inspection: entries carry an optional trailing `%` (word found in only one of the two source dictionaries — stripped, word kept) or `!` (365 occurrences; undocumented in the archive's own ReadMe in a form I could confirm — excluded entirely as the conservative reading, since a wrongly-kept possibly-offensive/variant entry is worse than a wrongly-dropped common one). Recorded in `scripts/README.md`.
- Curated `scripts/blocklist.txt` by hand (profanity/slurs, case-insensitive exact match) — not downloaded, no license concerns.
- Result: tier 1 = 28,125 words (3-7 letters). This is somewhat above the spec's "plausibly 5k-25k" guidance band; the 12dicts inflected-forms list is intentionally permissive (includes regular plurals/conjugations), and spot checks below didn't surface anything alarming. Flagging as a **CHECK FIRST-adjacent judgment call for the H1 review**, not silently accepting it as automatically fine.
- Tier 2 = 172,636 words (3+ letters) after blocklist.
- Spot checks: common words (cat, dog, house, water, happy, music) all present in tier 1. Known-obscure ENABLE words (zyzzyva, aahed, qanat) present in tier 2 only. A sampled blocklist term (fuck) absent from both tiers.

**`scripts/generate-levels.mjs`:**

- Seeded PRNG: `mulberry32`, no bare `Math.random()` anywhere in `scripts/` or `src/game/` (reuses `src/game/rng.js`'s `shuffleArray(arr, rng)`).
- Layout search: base word anchors the grid; candidate tier-1 sub-words (formable by multiset containment from the base word's letters) are shuffled by the seeded RNG and placed one at a time at every letter-matching anchor/direction, validated by re-deriving the full run structure after each tentative placement (no accidental adjacency), checking the 9x8 bounding box, and requiring an actual letter intersection (connectivity by construction). Placement stops at 7 words; a base word is discarded if it can't reach 4.
- **Bug found and fixed before committing:** the first run emitted `"bonus": []` for every level — `computeBonusWords` was comparing lowercase tier-2 words against a multiset built from the (uppercase) wheel letters, so `isFormable` never matched. Fixed by lowercasing the multiset input. Re-ran; bonus lists populated correctly (verified level 9 → 25 bonus words, level 1 → 1).
- No repair loop needed — `node scripts/generate-levels.mjs --seed 1` succeeded on the first working run: 40 levels, ramp `{4: 8, 5: 12, 6: 12, 7: 8}` matching the spec bands.
- Verified reproducibility: re-running `--seed 1` twice produced byte-identical `src/data/levels.json` (`diff` clean); `--seed 2` produced a different file.
- `tests/unit/generator-invariants.test.js` — written to independently re-derive runs/connectivity/bounding-box from the committed grid data (does not import any generator internals), per the runbook's "do not trust generator bookkeeping" instruction. Covers: schema validity, ≥40 levels, per-level (formability, 4-7 grid words, intersections agree, bounding box ≤9x8, connectivity, no accidental adjacency, no blocklisted word in grid/bonus, bonus sorted and disjoint from grid words, letter length matches the ramp band), and no two levels sharing a letter multiset. **43/43 passed on first run — repair loop R1 was allocated but not needed.**
- Full suite: `pnpm vitest run` → 5 files, 65 tests, all green. `pnpm build` exits 0 with the generated data.
- Manual play-check (Claude-in-Chrome against `pnpm dev`): level 1 ("BARN") renders correctly inside the viewport with the same visual identity as Phase 1; Hint reveals a grid cell. Programmatic check confirmed levels 1, 9, 21, and 33 all fit the 9x8 bounding box with a positive computed cell size (30-36px) — did not click through all four in-browser (would require completing intervening levels via drag, which is the same flaky-automation tradeoff noted in Phase 1; the invariant tests are the actual oracle for grid correctness across all 40 levels, not eyeballing four of them).
- Committed as one commit (`70c5877`): dictionary pipeline, generator, blocklist, `scripts/README.md` (sources/URLs/SHA-256s/licenses/regeneration commands), regenerated `src/data/levels.json`, generator invariant tests.

**Review packet — 5 sample levels across the ramp (seed 1):**

| Level | Letters | Grid words | Bonus count | First 15 bonus words |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 (4-letter band) | BARN | BARN, BRA, BRAN, RAN, NAB, BAN, BAR | 1 | ARB |
| 9 (5-letter band) | PONES | PONES, OPE, PESO, OPENS, NOS, OPEN, PEN | 25 | ENS, EON, EONS, EPOS, NOES, NOPE, NOSE, OES, ONE, ONES, ONS, OPES, OPS, OSE, PENS |
| 21 (6-letter band) | LOSSES | LOSSES, LOSS, SOLE, LOSES, OLE, SLOE, OLES | 15 | ELS, ESS, LESS, LOESS, LOSE, OES, OSE, OSES, SEL, SELS, SLOES, SOL, SOLES, SOLS, SOS |
| 33 (7-letter band) | GRANTEE | GRANTEE, EAR, RANGE, EGRET, NEAR, ENTER, ANT | 110 | AGE, AGEE, AGENE, AGENT, AGER, AGREE, ANE, ANGER, ANTE, ANTRE, ARE, ARETE, ARGENT, ART, ATE |
| 40 (7-letter band) | SPATULA | SPATULA, PLUS, SPAT, UPS, APT, SPLAT, ALPS | 67 | AAL, AALS, AAS, ALA, ALAS, ALP, ALS, ALT, ALTS, ASP, ATAP, ATAPS, ATLAS, LAP, LAPS |

**Word-quality flags for human review (not auto-resolved):**

- Level 9's grid includes **OPE** — archaic/dialectal for "open," technically in 12dicts but a plausible "that's not a word" moment for a player. This is exactly the class of judgment call the spec assigns to the H1 checkpoint rather than to the generator.
- Several bonus-only entries across levels are uncommon-but-real short words (ANE, ATAP, EGRET as grid word is fine — it's a real bird — SLOE/OLES as grid words are real but less common). Bonus-tier obscurity is explicitly fine per spec; flagging only where it appears as a **grid** word, since only grid words are held to the "must not read as fake" bar.
- Tier 1's 28,125-word count (vs. the spec's 5k-25k guidance band) is a possible contributor to lower-frequency words like OPE surfacing as grid words. If the reviewer wants a stricter tier 1, the fix is narrowing the `2of12inf.txt` filter (e.g., dropping `%`-marked entries instead of keeping them) and regenerating — not a hand-edit of `levels.json`.

**Phase 2 exit: PASS, pending human word-quality review.**

**HARD STOP H1 reached.** Waiting for review of the above before starting Phase 3.
